\section {Find Table By Column Name Using SQL Query}
/* Find the tables having the specific column or the columns containing a phrase in the name. For such a need to find the tables having the column, you can query the sys.tables system table and joining the sys.columns system table. */

\begin{verbatim}
SELECT
    sys.tables.name AS 'Table Name', 
    sys.tables.object_id AS 'Object ID', 
    sys.columns.name AS 'Column Name'
FROM
    sys.tables INNER JOIN sys.columns 
        ON sys.tables.object_id = sys.columns.object_id
WHERE
    sys.columns.name LIKE '%ProductID%'
ORDER BY 1;
\end{verbatim}

\section {Find the Database in which a Table is located}
SELECT * 
FROM  sys.tables 
WHERE     name LIKE     '%product%'

\begin{verbatim}
    Another method to get the list of tables having the same column is by querying the sys.columns table along with the OBJECT_NAME built-in meta data function instead of using sys.column table. Here is the select command.

SELECT
    OBJECT_NAME(object_id) AS 'Table Name', 
    object_id, 
    name AS 'Column Name'
FROM
    sys.columns 
WHERE
    name LIKE '%ProductID%'

\end{verbatim}
