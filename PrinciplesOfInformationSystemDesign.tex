First principle of Information Systems Design:
RESPONSIBILITY-DRIVEN DESIGN
Which PARTITION (database table or Java Class) is the best to :
1.	Store a piece of information
2.	To implement a certain business Process
TOPICS are the containers
FACTS are things that true in my environment which are relevant

\section  * {SQL CONCEPTS}
	\subsection  * {Normalization}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item We want many SMALL tables, not a few of BIG TABLES. This means can decouple our data sets.
	    \item Dr Codd - Cood's 13 Laws wants to RUN AWAY FROM the DATA FRAME in Cobol, in which all the data is scrunched together
	    \item NOW we need to connect TABLES together
	    \item connect tables on PK and FK if FIRST NORMAL Form

	\end{itemize}
		
\section {SQL Server}
